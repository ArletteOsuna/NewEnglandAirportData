                Abstract: Scientists are enthusiastically imagining ways in which artificial intelligence (AI) tools might improve research.
                          Why are AI tools so attractive and what are the risks of implementing them across the research pipeline? Here we
                          develop a taxonomy of scientists' visions for AI, observing that their appeal comes from promises to improve
                          productivity and objectivity by overcoming human shortcomings. But proposed AI solutions can also exploit our
                          cognitive limitations, making us vulnerable to illusions of understanding in which we believe we understand more
                          about the world than we actually do. Such illusions obscure the scientific community's ability to see the
                          formation of scientific monocultures, in which some types of methods, questions and viewpoints come to dominate
                          alternative approaches, making science less innovative and more vulnerable to errors. The proliferation of AI
                          tools in science risks introducing a phase of scientific enquiry in which we produce more but understand less. By
                          analyzing the appeal of these tools, we provide a framework for advancing discussions of responsible knowledge
                          production in the age of AI.

       Publication Venue: the International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)
                  Volume: 
                   Issue: 
                   Pages: 17-22

                Abstract: Resin transfer molding (RTM) is a composite manufacturing process that uses a liquid polymer matrix to create
                          complex-shaped parts. There are several challenges associated with RTM. One of the main challenges is ensuring
                          that the liquid polymer matrix is properly distributed throughout the composite material during the molding
                          process. If the matrix is not evenly distributed, the resulting part may have weak or inconsistent properties.
                          This is the challenge we tackle with the approach presented in this work. We implement an online control using
                          deep reinforcement learning (RL) to ensure a complete impregnation of the reinforcing fibers during the injection
                          phase, by controlling the input pressure on different inlets. This work uses this self-learning paradigm to
                          actively control the injection of an RTM process, which has the advantage of depending on a reward function
                          instead of a mathematical model, which would be the case for model predictive control. A reward function is more
                          straightforward to model and can be applied and adapted to more complex problems. RL algorithms have to be trained
                          through many iterations, for which we developed a simulation environment with a distributed and parallel
                          architecture. We show that the presented approach decreases the failure rate from 54% to 27%, by 50% compared to
                          the same setup with steady parameters.

       Publication Venue: MIS Quarterly
                  Volume: 47
                   Issue: 1

                Abstract: Unstructured multimedia data (text and audio) provides unprecedented opportunities to derive actionable
                          decision-making in the financial industry, in areas such as portfolio and risk management. However, due to
                          formidable methodological challenges, the promise of business value from unstructured multimedia data has not
                          materialized. In this study, we use a design science approach to develop DeepVoice, a novel nonverbal predictive
                          analysis system for financial risk prediction, in the setting of quarterly earnings conference calls. DeepVoice
                          forecasts financial risk by leveraging not only what managers say (verbal linguistic cues) but also how managers
                          say it (vocal cues) during the earnings conference calls. The design of DeepVoice addresses several challenges
                          associated with the analysis of nonverbal communication. We also propose a two-stage deep learning model to
                          effectively integrate managers' sequential vocal and verbal cues. Using a unique dataset of 6,047 earnings call
                          samples (audio recordings and textual transcripts) of S&P 500 firms across four years, we show that DeepVoice
                          yields remarkably lower risk forecast errors than that achieved by previous efforts. The improvement can also
                          translate into nontrivial economic gains in options trading. The theoretical and practical implications of
                          analyzing vocal cues are discussed.

                Abstract: Reciprocity and recognition play vital roles in facilitating user engagement in virtual communities, but seldom
                          research examines the interplay between two. This study thus explores how recognition can interact with
                          reciprocity to jointly influence knowledge contribution. Drawing from equity theory, we propose two hypotheses,
                          with one to test the reciprocity effect and another to investigate the interaction effect between reciprocity and
                          recognition in the Q&A community. We collected data from Stack Overflow and performed fixed-effect panel data
                          analyses to test our hypotheses. Our preliminary results indicate that the receipt of answers from others in the
                          past can increase current knowledge contribution, but the observed reciprocity effect can be dampened by the
                          receipt of community recognitions. This study can contribute to extant literature by not only confirming the
                          existence of reciprocity and its temporal effect, but also unveiling the unintended impact that recognition may
                          have on reciprocity in the virtual communities.

                Abstract: Human-computer interaction (HCI) is the area of intersection between psychology and the social sciences, on the
                          one hand, and computer science and technology, on the other. HCI researchers analyze and design-specific
                          user-interface technologies (e.g., three-dimensional pointing devices, interactive video). They study and improve
                          the processes of technology development (e.g., usability evaluation, design rationale). They develop and evaluate
                          new applications of technology (e.g., computer conferencing, software design environments). Through the past two
                          decades, HCI has progressively integrated its scientific concerns with the engineering goal of improving the
                          usability of computer systems and applications, thus establishing a body of technical knowledge and methodology.
                          HCI continues to provide a challenging test domain for applying and developing psychology and social science in
                          the context of technology development and use.

                   Title: Taking the chat out of chatbot? Collecting user reviews with chatbots and web forms
       Publication Venue: Journal of Management Information Systems
                  Volume: 41
                   Issue: 1

             Article No.: 
                Abstract: Firms are beginning to use chatbots to collect information from users, a task traditionally done through forms. We
                          used two experiments to investigate how collecting reviews using chatbots in place of forms might impact user
                          experience and, in turn, alter the nature of the reviews submitted by users. Study 1 compares chatbots to web
                          forms, finding that chatbots may improve perceived efficiency but otherwise have no discernible effect on
                          satisfaction and usage intention. At the same time, chatbot usage results in shorter, lower-quality reviews. While
                          structured templates enhance form-based reviews, introducing structure to chatbot interactions does not positively
                          impact satisfaction and usage intent, potentially making the process less efficient. Nonetheless, a structured
                          chatbot approach yields longer reviews and mitigates declines in quality. Adding structure to a chatbot takes the
                          chat out of the chatbot, turning the interaction from casual conversation to a formal process, as demonstrated in
                          Study 2. Hence, while this structured approach for chatbots improves review quality without harming satisfaction
                          and usage intent, it may not be the most effective method for enhancing the reviewer experience. Our research
                          shows that the chatbot and structure pulled users towards contradicting genre rules (the social structures that
                          guide technology use) and triggered users to subconsciously enact distinctly different thought patterns as they
                          composed reviews.
